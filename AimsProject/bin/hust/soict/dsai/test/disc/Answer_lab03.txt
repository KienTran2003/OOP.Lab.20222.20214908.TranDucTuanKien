2.Working with method overloading
2.1: I prefer method which signature is a array because when we use array we can control the length of it and run errors as soon as possible,

-In swap method: o1 and o2 copy references from jungle nand cinderella, then they overwrite reference
-In new swap method, after copy references, we change data in that reference which jungle and cinderella also refer to.

3.Passing parameter
Java always pass by value

6.toString() method should return String type
